## Project 1:  Ball Drop in the WSU Atrium

  Plot the position and the velocity of a ball being dropped from the third floor in the WSU Atrium

## Project 2: Finding differentials with Area

  Find the relationship between $dA$, $s$, and $ds$ for $A = s^2$, and several other power functions

## Project 3:  Finding changes in Functions

  Find the relationship between $dx$ and $df$ for exponential, logarithm, sine, and cosine functions

# Project for Quiz 1:  

  Students fit a function to data for the spread of oil on the ocean. They also calculate the change in the spread
  by computing the change and fitting a function to that change, and also by using differentials.  They discuss whether
  their two answers are the same or different.

## Project 5:  Expanding upon Linear Approximation for functions

  We develop two ways to approximate functions.  The first method uses several segments.  The second method uses several derivatives.
  The calculations are done in DESMOS; The COLAB page provides space to save work.

# Project for Quiz 2:  

  For Part (A), students generate approximations to the function $y = ln(x)$.  For Part (B), students solve a related rates problem both computationally and algebraically.

## Project 6:  Sally's Walk - Determining Change in Position from Velocity

  We use sums to find the total change in position for Sally from her velocity data.  This is done both using Desmos and Google Sheets.
